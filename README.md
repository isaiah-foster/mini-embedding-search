### The goal of the applications project is to give you incentive to explore something you find interesting that uses linear algebra. Here are some suggested activities:

#### 1. 
Research and write a traditional essay (at least two pages, 12pt double spaced or equivalent)
on a topic that uses linear algebra. If you expect to use this essay for your writing portfolio,
make sure you follow standard writing protocol and referencing.
#### 2. 
Engage generative AI in a conversation about someting you find interesting that uses linear
algebra. Make sure you ask follow up questions. Finally, critique the information you were
given and your experience using AI in this way.
#### 3. 
Engage with a computer program that uses Linear Algebra. In particular, Matlab has several
interesting packages that do things from image recognition to compressing data. Try one out.
Write about or make a video that illustrates your experience.
#### 4. 
Write your own code to implement an linear algebraic idea or algorithm in software of your
choice. Hand in your code and write about your experience with this. Did it help you to
better understand the concept you coded?
#### 5. 
If you have another idea, suggest it to me and we’ll figure out how to get it to meet my
criteria.
